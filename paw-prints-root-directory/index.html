        <h2>Site Purpose:</h2>
        <p id="sitepurpose"> The purpose of this website is to give the audience insight into the doggy daycare and boarding business through my experience in working for one for three years. The website is also a means of sharing various dog pictures that have been accumulating in my camera roll from work and creating a blog about the different seasons and what it’s like to work during them. This will be beneficial for dog lovers who aren’t satisfied with the number of dogs they know and want some more information about the doggy boarding business.</p>

        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p class="details">My name is Alexander Aviles, I am the developer of this website which is for my final project in BIT112 (a web authoring class) that I am currently taking at Cascadia College. My mother is Native American and my father is El Salvadorian, so that makes me and my siblings a pretty uncommon combination of ethnicities. I hope to visit El Salvador again someday to visit some of my relatives because the last time I went was back in 2010. I played baseball throughout high school and my favorite baseball team is the San Fransisco Giants. I also play video games and built my own desktop in high school.</p>

        <h3>How I started:</h3>
        <p class="details">I moved out of my parents house the day after I turned eighteen and moved to a house between the towns of Monroe and Duvall, Wa. I got a job bussing tables at a restraunt, but this got old after a while and I wanted to find a less stressful job. This led me to applying to a doggy daycare and boarding business in King County that I heard about from a friend. I went in for an interview and met the dogs for the first time, which is overwhelming at first but once you get them walking around they seem to calm down well. After walking the dogs for about a lap they broke out into a fight. I had to pull a Great Pyranese out of the fight by his collar and yelled at the two other dogs involved to get them to stop. My boss was impressed at how I handles the situation and gave me the job on the spot.</p>

        <h3>About My Job:</h3>
        <p class="details"> I've been working at this facility for three years now and my main responsibility is walking the dogs and cleaning out the kennel room. After a couple months I was able to switch to a part time schedule so I could go back to school to pursue a degree. This jop allows me to pay for my classes without going into debt which is ideal for me and I get to meet a lot of different amazing dogs. The facility is on about one and a half acres of property that is completely enclosed with fencing to prevent the dogs from getting out. The dogs that spend the night eat breakfast at seven a.m. every morning and eat dinner at five p.m. Between those hours they are walked all together around the property off-leash to get them tired for the night. Some of the dogs get a time out in a kennel if they are misbehaving and some get to hangout on the house side of the business where my boss lives. We deal with all types of dog breeds and some of the dogs take medication that we administer to them with their food.</p>
