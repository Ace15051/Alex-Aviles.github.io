        <h2>Spring:</h2>
        <p class="seasons">Spring is one of the better seasons to be a dog walker in Washington, even though it can be a rainy season. Spring is when the grass starts growing again, which means that I get to mow the grass more often as it gets longer. The reason why you want to keep the grass groomed is because if you don't, it becomes overgrown and it gets harder to find poop piles as they hide in the grass like land mines waiting for someone to step on them. This also means that weed whacking becomes another responsibility of mine as the borders of fences get tufts of grass that need maintaining to make the facility look nice. The amount of dogs that we get during spring stays relatively low until spring break, then we get upwards of forty dogs spending the night as families need a place for their dogs as they go on vacation.</p>

        <h2>Summer:</h2>
        <p class="seasons">Summer is in my opinion the best season to be a dog walker,  because it is the warmest time of the year and reminds me of living in California. One of the biggest responsibilities a dog walker has during this season is making sure the dogs are staying hydrated, which is achieved by keeping all of the water bowls filled all the time with water that is fresh. We are also conscious of the dogs that shouldn't be out walking in the heat because of their age or fur type. We keep kiddy pools around the facility during summer to help the dogs cool down and beat the heat. Many of the dogs have a blast playing and splashing around in the water with each other. Since the creek in the big field dries up we are able to take the dogs out there and let them run around for a good hour which gets them to expend a lot of their energy. Usually by the end of my shift all of the dogs are just laying in the kennel room together on the cool cement floor all tuckered out.</p>
        <h2>Fall:</h2>
        <p class="seasons">This is when the weather starts to change back to colder temperatures, so bundling up and wearing warmer clothes becomes essential. It is also the time of year that mushrooms start to grow around the property which we have to be diligent about picking up so the dogs don’t end up eating the wrong ones and getting very sick. The grass stops growing as rapidly which makes mowing less necessary to do as often which is good for me, and the trees start to change color which I always enjoy witnessing. However, when the leaves fall someone has to rake them up and that so happens to be me, and this was one of my least favorite jobs during my childhood so it’s not my favorite thing to do but needs to be done nonetheless. Thanksgiving is during this season which is another one of busiest times of the year for us, as families need someone to look after their dogs while they travel and meet up with family for the holiday. I have worked the last three thanksgivings and every time we have had upwards of fifty dogs, it is quite an experience working with this many dogs off-leash because there always tends to be a couple of dogs that don’t get along.</p>
        <h2>Winter:</h2>
        <p class="seasons">Winter is the coldest season of the year which can make dog walking pretty miserable to do as you have to endure temperatures as low as twenty degrees some weeks. One of the only advantages of this time of year is that poop piles get frozen overnight which makes them smell a lot less and also easier to pick up. This is also the season of snow, and the amount of snow depends from year to year. For example, it hasn’t snowed once this winter which I’m not complaining about but we are probably bound to get some soon. Once it starts snowing the property looks like a winter wonderland and the dogs usually have a blast playing in the snow and eating it. I feel bad for the short-haired dogs who come because they tend to stay in the main kennel room just to stay warm because they can’t outside. Wearing snow boots to work also becomes essential during this time because wearing anything that isn't waterproof would be miserable. Wool socks also become nice to wear because your feet still get cold.</p>
