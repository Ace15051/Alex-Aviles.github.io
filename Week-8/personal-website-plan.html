        <h2>Target audience</h2>

        <p>
         The target audience for my website is anyone who is interested in the doggy daycare and boarding business. It is also intended for any dog lovers as they will be able to view pictures of many different breeds and to get a little insight on what I have been doing for the past three years as a dog walker.

        <h2>Site purpose</h2>

        <p>
          This website will introduce people to the doggy daycare and boarding business, wether they have an interest in getting a job there or simply bringing their dog to a kennel like the one I work at. It will also give information about different breeds I have worked with and what some of my favorites are.

        <h2>Site personality</h2>

        <p>
          My site will have a warm color scheme to make new visitors to the site feel more invited and calm. It is not a professional website or used for business so it will display more of a social conscience, and it will change over time as more pictures can be added and I will be able to add onto the blog as I have more experiences to talk about. I would like the person to feel inclined to return to the website after viewing it, and to feel like they got some insight on the doggy daycare and boarding business.

        <h2>Limitations</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              I expect users to have fast internet to load pictures that will be available on the site. I expect it will be viewed primarily on either google chrome, firefox, or safari. Users should be comfortable with using technology to access to site through a desktop, it would also be nice to format the site to accomodate mobile.
