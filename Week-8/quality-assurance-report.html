    <h2>Quality Assurance Report</h2>
    <h3>What does Quality Assurance mean for web site development?</h3>
    <p>Quality Assurance on the web, often referred to as QA, is a proof and review of a product or deliverable - in our case web applications and websites. QA is independent of the design and development processes in order to test a product’s many uses in the myriad of ways an enduser, especially those unfamiliar with the software, might. The QA process is expected to discover design issues and development errors while testing a product’s user interface (UI) and gauging the user experience (UX).</p>
    <h3>Describe the two key principles of Quality Assurance: "Fit for Purpose" and "Right First Time."</h3>
    <p>There are two principles to quality assurance. One is “fit for purpose,” meaning the product or service meets its intended purpose. The other is “right first time,” in which any mistakes are immediately dealt with.With the two above principles in play, the goal is to make the product or service work correctly all the time through the management of the variables in the project. To do so, quality assurance involves the management of the quality of raw materials, assemblies, products and components; services related to production; and the management, production and inspection process.</p>
    <h3>How do web standard relate to web quality?</h3>
    <p>Web standards are rules and guidelines established by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) developed to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. Without getting technical, simply it's the guideline for the mark-up language which determines how a web page. displays in a visitor's browser window. Web quality refers to how all these components work together in a website which is ideally smoothly and without error. So the goal is to be consistent with the html markup so it works across devices and browsers which helps the web quality of the sites that are being developed.</p>
    <h3>escribe what Web Accessibility means. What steps you can take to make your pages more accessible?</h3>
    <p>Web accessibility is the inclusive practice of ensuring there are no barriers that prevent interaction with, or access to, websites on the World Wide Web by people with physical disabilities, situational disabilities, and socio-economic restrictions on bandwidth and speed. You want your website to be accessible to everyone wether they aren't capable of using a mouse or are using something like a mobile device. You can make website colorblind friendly as it accounts for people with colorblindness in the color scheme, adding skip to content links can also help a web page, and making images adaptive helps mobile users as the web page adjusts to the size of the display.</p>
