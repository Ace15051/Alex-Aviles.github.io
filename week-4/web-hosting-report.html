        <h2>Web Hosting Report</h2>
        <h3>What is a web server? Why would you need one?</h3>
        <p>A web server is a computer that runs websites. It's a computer program that distributes web pages as they are requisitioned. The basic objective of the webserver is to store, process and deliver web pages to the users. You would need one to run your website so it is available on the internet via intercommunication through hyperlinks.</p>
        <h3>plain why getting a domain name is not enough to put your site up on the web.</h3>
        <p>The domain name secures the name or web address of your intended website to create but it will not make it available on the web. The webserver processes and reads the code to make the website actually available on the web.</p>
        <h3>What service does a website hosting company provide?</h3>
        <p>Web hosting is a service that allows organizations and individuals to post a website or web page onto the Internet. A web host, or web hosting service provider, is a business that provides the technologies and services needed for the website or webpage to be viewed on the Internet.</p>
        <h3>What are the most important characteristics to look for in selecting a good web hosting company?</h3>
        <p>Some of the most important characteristics to look for is Reliability, Speed, Space, Substantial Bandwidth, Support, Standard Pricing/ Payment Plans.</p>
        <h3>Research companies that provide website hosting plans. On average, what is the price range (price per month) for hosting a website?</h3>
        <p>It seems that the average price range per month for the most basic web hosting package on these web sites varies from $2.50 all the way to 10$ per month with a three-year contract. These plans get a lot pricier when you upgrade packages and the small amount per month looks nice but the companies charge you upfront for the whole three years.</p>
        <h3>What are the most important features for you when reviewing a hosting plan? </h3>
        <p>Important features for me when reviewing a hosting plan is Reliability, Speed, and Standard Pricing/Payment plans.</p>

    <h3>Identify one of the companies and hosting plans as the best value for the price.</h3>
        <p>Dreamhost seems to be the best bang for your buck as it is a higher tiered package so more comes with it compared to the other web hosting companies. They also offer a 97 day Money-Back Gurantee so if you aren't pleased with their service you can cancel and get your money back.</p>
